<div class='page'><strong><h1># Linux - Processes</h1></strong><br />• Each process has an ID associated with it called the process ID (PID)<br />• PIDs are assigned in the order the processes are created<br /><br /><strong><h2>## Processes &amp; terminals</h2></strong><br />• Processes are connected to terminals<br />   ◇ e.g. you run <code>find</code> and you close the terminal window, the <code>find</code> process goes along with it<br />• Daemons <em>are not</em> connected to terminals<br />   ◇ daemons run in the background and we don&#39;t want them to close<br />   ◇ for daemons, the TTY column lists them as ? - meaning they don&#39;t have a controlling terminal<br /><br /><strong><h2>## Processes &amp; the kernel</h2></strong><br />• The kernel is in charge of processes<br />• When you run a program...<br />   ◇ the kernel loads up the code of the program in memory<br />   ◇ determines and allocates resources to the program<br />   ◇ and keeps track of the process<br />• The kernel knows: <br />   ◇ The status of the process<br />   ◇ The resources the process is using and receives<br />   ◇ The process owner<br />   ◇ Signal handling<br />   ◇ basically everything<br /><br /><strong><h2>## /proc</h2></strong><br />• In Linux, everything is a file<br />• Processes are “files” too<br />• Every process running will have a “file” entry in <code>/proc</code><br />   ◇ <code>/proc</code> is full of process IDs<br />   ◇ <code>cat /proc/12345/status</code> - will show process state information<br /><br /><strong><h2>## ps</h2></strong><br /><code>ps</code> - list running processes<br /><code>ps aux</code><br />   ◇ <code>a</code> - display all running processes<br />   ◇ <code>u</code> - show more details about the processes<br />   ◇ <code>x</code> - list all processes than don&#39;t have a TTY<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">$&nbsp;ps&nbsp;aux<br />USER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PID&nbsp;%CPU&nbsp;%MEM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VSZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSS&nbsp;TTY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STAT&nbsp;START&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TIME&nbsp;COMMAND<br />root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6126&nbsp;&nbsp;0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7776&nbsp;&nbsp;4528&nbsp;pts/0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;06:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0:00&nbsp;bash<br />root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7633&nbsp;&nbsp;0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8464&nbsp;&nbsp;2944&nbsp;pts/0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18:53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0:00&nbsp;ps&nbsp;aux</div></div><br /><br />• USER: The effective user (the one whose access we are using)<br />• PID: Process ID<br />• %CPU: CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running<br />• %MEM: Ratio of the process&#39;s resident set size to the physical memory on the machine<br />• VSZ: Virtual memory usage of the entire process<br />• RSS: Resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used<br />• TTY: Controlling terminal associated with the process<br />• STAT: Process status code<br />   ◇ R = running or runnable, it is just waiting for the CPU to process it<br />   ◇ S = Interruptible sleep, waiting for an event to complete, such as input from the terminal<br />   ◇ D = Uninterruptible sleep, processes that cannot be killed or interrupted with a signal, usually to make them go away you have to reboot or fix the issue<br />   ◇ Z = Zombie, we discussed in a previous lesson that zombies are terminated processes that are waiting to have their statuses collected<br />   ◇ T = Stopped, a process that has been suspended/stopped<br />• START: Start time of the process<br />• TIME: Total CPU usage time<br />• COMMAND: Name of executable/command<br /><br /><strong><h2>## top</h2></strong><br /><code>top</code> gives you real time information about the processes running on your system instead of a snapshot<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
