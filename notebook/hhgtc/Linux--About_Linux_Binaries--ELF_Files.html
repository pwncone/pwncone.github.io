<div class='page'><strong><h1># Linux - ELF Binaries</h1></strong><br />ELF stands for <em>Executable and Linkable Format</em>, and is the file format for binaries/executables on Linux.<br /><br /><a href="https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/cns/labs/lab-03">https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/cns/labs/lab-03</a><br /><a href="https://linux-audit.com/elf-binaries-on-linux-understanding-and-analysis/">https://linux-audit.com/elf-binaries-on-linux-understanding-and-analysis/</a><br /><a href="http://fluxius.handgrep.se/2011/10/20/the-art-of-elf-analysises-and-exploitations/">http://fluxius.handgrep.se/2011/10/20/the-art-of-elf-analysises-and-exploitations/</a><br /><br /><strong><h2>## Why do we need a file format for binaries?</h2></strong><br />Operating systems have 2 fundamental abstractions:<br />   ◇ files (binaries)<br />   ◇ processes<br /><br />Binaries are a <strong>static</strong> representation of resources.<br />Processes are a <strong>dynamic</strong> representation of resources.<br /><br />The process of transforming a static file into a dynamic process is called loading - done by a <strong>loader</strong>.<br /><br /><strong><h3>### The Loader</h3></strong><br />The loader is code that&#39;s part of the operating system.<br />In order to ‘load’ the program, the loader reads meta-information provided in the ELF file.<br />It reads information like<br />      ▪ the process&#39;s memory layout<br />      ▪ the address of the program&#39;s first instruction (the entry point)<br />      ▪ the addresses of each of the program&#39;s sections (.data, .text etc.)<br /><br />All of this information is specified in the ELF header/file format.<br /><br />The loader then uses this information to set the program up for execution by allocating memory for the program, creating data structures etc.<br /><br /><strong><h2>## The ELF Format</h2></strong><br />There are 4 main parts to the ELF format:<br /><br />• <strong>ELF Header</strong> -  gives a summary of the file - 32-bit/64-bit, endianness, entry point etc.<br />• <strong>ELF Section Header</strong> -  describes the sections of the program and their location in the binary - <code>.text</code> <code>.bss</code> etc.<br />• <strong>ELF Program Header</strong> - defines the segments of the binary, which sections are in which segment, and the address of each of the segments when they&#39;re loaded into memory.<br />• <strong>ELF Symbol Table</strong> - stores information about variables, functions, objects, classes etc.<br /><br /></div>
