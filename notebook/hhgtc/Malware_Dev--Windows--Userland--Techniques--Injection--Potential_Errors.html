<div class='page'><strong><h1># Potential Errors</h1></strong><br />There&#39;s quite errors you can encounter whilst trying to inject PEs and DLLs.<br /><br /><code><h2>0xc0000005</h2></code><br />This means that code execution is being prevented (or errors)<br /><br />• DEP (Data Execution Prevention) might be preventing your code from running (most \system32 applications have DEP enabled)<br />• Try disabling compiler optimisations. These can mess with your injected code / shellcode<br />• Security checks might be blocking execution from READ/WRITE/EXECUTABLE memory<br />   ◇ Try disabling Security Checks in Visual Studio if you&#39;re injecting into yourself<br />   ◇ Try setting the memory to R/X (executing from writeable memory is usually seen as malicious and flagged)<br /><br /><code><h2>0xc0000142</h2></code><h2> </h2><br />Means your image subsystems don&#39;t match.</div>
