<div class='page'><strong><h1># Linux - Filesystem Types</h1></strong><br />A file system (or filesystem) is used to control how data is stored and retrieved<br />Without a file system, there would be no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins.<br /><br />• There are lots of different filesystem implementations available<br />   ◇ Some are faster than others, some support larger capacity storage etc.<br />• Different filesystems have different ways of organizing their data<br />• Because there&#39;s many different filesystems implemenetions<br />   ◇ applications need a way to deal with the different operations<br />   ◇ To solve this, there&#39;s the Virtual File System (VFS) abstraction layer<br />   ◇ The VFS sits between applications and the filesystem and interfaces the two<br />      ▪ Therefore, no matter what filesystem you have, your applications will work with your filesystem<br />• Each parition can have a different filesytstem<br /><br /><strong><h2>## Journalling</h2></strong><br />• Journalling logs changes to your filesystem to a log file just before they happen<br />   ◇ .e.g you transfer a file, the log file (journal) notes down what&#39;s going to happen<br />• When the file transfer is finished, the journal marks the task as complete<br />• Journalling improves reliability of filesystems by logging filesystem updates<br />• If a crash happens, the disk knows which files have been completed against the disk and which haven&#39;t<br /><br /><strong><h2>## Common Desktop Filesystem Types</h2></strong><br /><strong><h3>### ext4</h3></strong><br />   ◇ ext4 is what most modern Linux filesystems are nowadays<br />   ◇ stands for <em>Fourth Extended Filesystem</em><br />   ◇ supports 1 exbabyte volumes<br />   ◇ supports 16tb files<br />   ◇ backwards compatible with ext2 and ext3<br />   ◇ can pre-allocate space on disk for files using fallocate() system call (allows for media streaming/databases)<br />   ◇ unlimited number of subdirectories<br />   ◇ journalling<br /><br /><strong><h3>### Btrfs</h3></strong><br />• Btrfs stands for <em>B-Tree File System</em><br />• Btrfs is a new filesystem for Linux <br />   ◇ supports snapshots<br />   ◇ incremental backups<br />   ◇ has performance increases<br />• It&#39;s widely available, but not quite stable yet<br /><br /><strong><h3>### XFS</h3></strong><br />• XFS is a high performance journaling file system<br />• Great for a system with large files, such as a media server<br /><br /><strong><h3>### NTFS and FAT</h3></strong><br />• NTFS and FAT are Windows filesystems<br /><br /><strong><h3>### HFS+</h3></strong><br />• HFS+ is a Macintosh filesystem<br /></div>
