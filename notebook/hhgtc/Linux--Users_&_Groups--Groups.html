<div class='page'><strong><h1># Linux - User Management - Groups</h1></strong><br />• Groups are sets of users. <br />• Each gropu has a group name and an assosciated <em>GUID</em> - a group user id.<br />• Groups allow users to share files with other users in the same group. <br />• Groups are usually created based on teams e.g. marketing/web dev/business etc.<br /><br /><strong><h2>## GUIDs - Group IDs</h2></strong><br />• When you create a new user, they&#39;re also given their own group<br />   ◇ e.g. Bob&#39;s UID = 1001, Bob&#39;s GUID = 1001<br />• A user can be part of multiple groups<br />   ◇ e.g. Bob works in both the Marketing and Finance departments<br />      ▪ so Bob is added to both the Marketing and Finance groups<br />      ▪ this means that he can read any file created by anyone in those groups<br />• All groups have a GUID- Group ID<br />    e.g. Marketing = 2004, Finance = 2005<br /><br /><br /></div>
