<div class='page'><h1># Drawing</h1><br />Drawing text &amp; lines whilst internal.<br /><br /><h2>## Use the game&#39;s graphics API</h2><br />You could use whatever graphics API the game is using to draw your text/boxes<br />e.g. DirectX9, DirectX11, etc.<br />For example, CSGO uses DirectX9. Therefore, you use DirectX9 to draw your cheats.<br /><br /><h2>## Use the game&#39;s internal functions</h2><br />Instead of interacting with the game&#39;s graphics API, you could use the game&#39;s internal functions to draw inside.<br />The game&#39;s internal functions are most likely wrappers around the graphics API.<br /><br />This is common in CoD cheats as they have a lot of internal functions to draw,<br />like drawing text and boxes.<br /><br />It&#39;s also common in barebones/simple assembly cheats where you don&#39;t want to write your own drawing code,<br />so you just use the game&#39;s instead.<br /><br /><h2>## Use an external graphics library</h2><br />Use an external graphics library like ImGui or Nuklear to draw text/boxes. <br />This is getting pretty common nowadays.<br /><br /><h2>## Create an Internal Overlay</h2><br />Don&#39;t know much about this.<br />See this talked about with Battlefield 1/5 cheats instead of using ImGui.<br /><br /><h2>## Hook a Trusted Overlay</h2><br />Instead of drawing in Dx9&#39;s EndScene or Dx11&#39;s Present, you could hook a function in a trusted overlay and draw there: Discord, Steam, Origin, etc.<br />These modules often have DLLs loaded into the game so they can draw their overlays.<br />The DLLs are trusted because they&#39;re legitimate applications.<br />You can hook some of these overlays to draw your cheat overlay instead.<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><h3>### Discord</h3></strong><br />• <a href="https://guidedhacking.com/threads/x64-discord-overlay-hooking-example-directx-11.14498/">https://guidedhacking.com/threads/x64-discord-overlay-hooking-example-directx-11.14498/</a><br /><br /><strong><h3>### Steam</h3></strong><br />• <a href="https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counterstrike-global-offensive/142166-using-gameoverlayrenderer-dll-draw.html">https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counterstrike-global-offensive/142166-using-gameoverlayrenderer-dll-draw.html</a><br /><br /><strong><h3>### Origin</h3></strong><br /><br /><h3>### Nvidia</h3><br /></div>
