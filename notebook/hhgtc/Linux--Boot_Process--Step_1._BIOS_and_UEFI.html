The stage 1 boot loader looks through the partition table for a stage 2 boot loader and loads it<br />   ◇ (the program is only 440 bytes in size, so it has limited functionality due to its size)<br /><br /><strong>Stage 2 Bootloader</strong><br />1. The stage 2 boot loader (e.g. GRUB) loads the kernel into RAM<br />   ◇ (the stage 2 boot loader is stored in a partition)<br /><br /><strong><h2>## UEFI</h2></strong><br />• UEFI performs EFI booting<br />• UEFI was designed to be used with a GPT partition table<br /><br /><strong>### </strong><strong><h3>UEFI and GPT (GUID Partition Table)</h3></strong><br />• The bootlader (GRUB) is stored in the EFI System Partition - called the ESP<br />• The ESP is FAT32 and 550MiB in size</div>
