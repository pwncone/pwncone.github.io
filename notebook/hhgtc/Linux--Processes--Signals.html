<div class='page'><strong><h1># Linux - Processes - Signals</h1></strong><br />• Signals are software interrupts<br />• Signals notify a process that something has happened<br />   ◇ If hardware issues occur, the kernel notifies the process<br />   ◇ If hardware issues occur, the kernel notifies the process<br /><br /><strong><h2>## Signals &amp; processes</h2></strong><br />• Delivery<br />   ◇ When a signal is generated by some event, it gets delivered to a process<br />   ◇ The signal is in a pending state until it&#39;s delivered<br />• Processes have signal masks<br />   ◇ Signal masks can be set to block signal delivery<br />   ◇ Some signals are unblockable, like SIGKILL. The KILL signal destroys the process.<br />• When a signal is delivered, a process can do a multitude of things: <br />   ◇ Ignore the signal<br />   ◇ &quot;Catch&quot; the signal and perform a specific handler routine<br />   ◇ The process can be terminated, as opposed to the normal exit system call<br />   ◇ Block the signal, depending on the signal mask<br /><br /><strong><h2>## Common signals</h2></strong><br />• Each signal is defined by integers with symbolic names<br />• They&#39;re in the form of <code>SIGxxx</code><br />• Common signals include:<br />   ◇ SIGHUP or HUP or 1: Hangup<br />   ◇ SIGINT or INT or 2: Interrupt (Ctrl-C)<br />   ◇ SIGKILL or KILL or 9: Kill<br />   ◇ SIGSEGV or SEGV or 11: Segmentation fault<br />   ◇ SIGTERM or TERM or 15: Software termination<br />   ◇ SIGSTOP or STOP: Stop<br /></div>
