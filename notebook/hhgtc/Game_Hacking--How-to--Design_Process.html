<div class='page'><strong><h1># Design Process</h1></strong><br />Just my throughts on the process of designing cheats<br /><br /><strong><h2>## Internal</h2></strong><br />• Inject successfully into the game (spawn a message box)<br />• Get window size (directX?) / game resolution (openGL?)<br />• Hook buffer that runs every frame. Get this to work without the game crashing<br />• Draw a box, a line, and text in-game<br />• Draw a box/line/text where you want to in-game (make sure the screen coordiantes draw where you say)<br />• Loop through the players in game and write data to console to verify (name/stats/whatever/whole struct) <br />• Get world to screen working (in a console, print TRUE if enemy on-screen, FALSE if enemy off-screen)<br />• Start with basic ESP - print text over enemies OR create snaplines (both are an equal step imo)<br />• Draw a box around enemy<br /><br />At this point you&#39;re pretty comfortable doing whatever.<br />Implement triggerbot, more advanced ESP, aimobt; whatever you feel like.<br />You know your code works now so you can just about do anything and debug it if it goes wrong.</div>
