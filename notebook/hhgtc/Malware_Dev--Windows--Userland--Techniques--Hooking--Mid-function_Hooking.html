<div class='page'><h1># Mid-function Hooking</h1><br />Hooks get detected when they&#39;re at the start of the function (just look for an E9).<br />Instead, you can hook in the middle of the function.<br />This can cause problems because it means you trash some of the registers the function has <br />already set up for itself, so take it on a function by function basis.<br />There&#39;s no catch-all for mid-function hooks where it&#39;ll work with every function (that I know of).</div>
