<div class='page'><strong><h1># Linux - Filesystem - Swap Space</h1></strong><br />• Swap space is used when phsyical RAM is full<br />• Inactive/idle memory pages from idle programs get moved into the swap space partitioned on your hard drive<br />   ◇ This frees up room in RAM<br />• On modern systems, configure 20% of amount of RAM as swap space<br />   ◇ e.g. 8gb RAM = 1.6GB swap space (i.e. just use 2GB)<br />   ◇ This is because we have more RAM nowadays, so don&#39;t need much swap space anymore<br />• In the old days, you would configure 2x memory size as swap space<br /><br /></div>
