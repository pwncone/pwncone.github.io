This value is known as a <strong>canary</strong>.<br /><br />(The terminology is a reference to the historic practice of using canaries down coal mines. The canary would be affected by toxic gas earlier than the miners, and die, thus providing a biological warning system to the workers in the mine.)<br /><br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/616-1.png" alt="images/616-1.png" /></a><br /><br />When the called function returns after running, the canary value gets checked against a 2nd copy of the value (which is stored elsewhere - could be a variable, or in a register, whatever).<br />If the canary value has changed - the program exits and reports <code>*** stack smashing detected ***</code><br />If the canary is the same - the program continues to the return address.<br /><br /><strong><h3>### gcc switches</h3></strong><br />• Enable canaries - <code>-fstack-protector</code><br />• Disable canaries - <code>-fno-stack-protector</code><br /><br /><strong><h2>## Bypassing Stack Canaries</h2></strong><br />• Stack canaries only protect against buffer overflows <br />   ◇ Arbitrary memory writes (e.g. to offsets that can be controlled by the attacker) can be crafted so that they never touch the canary value<br />• Stack canaries are vulnerable to the same set of attacks as ASLR<br />   ◇ You could guess/retrieve the canary value via an information leak<br />   ◇ You could guess/retrieve the canary value via brute force<br />• You might be able to modify the reference value</div>
