<div class='page'><strong><h1># A word on stealth</h1></strong><br />Stealth is about blending in, and not leaving a trail. That&#39;s it.<br />It&#39;s a lot about understanding the current context that you&#39;re in hiding your attacks behind commonplace activities.<br /><br />• Use commonplace sysadmin tools rather than known hacking tools (if you can avoid it)<br />• Avoid dropping files to disk (deploy your own SMB share, remotely mount disk via RDP, etc.)<br />• Leave persistence where it makes sense</div>
